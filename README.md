Clone the Repo.

``` git clone https://github.com/mdkvaofficial/cloud_storage.git ```

Replace the "sample.txt" file to any file you want.

Make sure that the name of your newly added file is "sample.txt" or else you will have to replace the name in the link of "index.html" file to the name of your newly added file to make it work correctly.

Good Luck.
